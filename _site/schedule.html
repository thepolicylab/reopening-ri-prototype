                <p>How should we be thinking about new technologies involving Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Machine Learning, and what do we need to know as managers and practitioners to responsibly leverage these opportunities?</p>

We’ll talk about the ways that these technologies can help governments scale their impact, while also getting into the details around the risks of bias, bad data, and algorithmic decision-making.</p>

                <p>This session is designed for managers and practitioners working at governments and universities, including division managers, data analysts, and subject matter experts.

                <p>Before we can waste a lot of money on bad technology, someone has to <i>agree</i> to waste all that money. Join the founder of the federal government’s <a href="https://10x.gsa.gov/">10x</a> investment program for a conversation about how we fund technology projects, and how we can avoid the pitfalls of huge procurements running late and over-budget. We’ll share real-world examples of governments building on the success of venture capital, by uncovering and elevating the most promising ideas from the federal workforce, then starting funding small and increasing their investment as ideas mature into a sustainable projects.</p>

            <p>Do residents come in for the same processes over and over again? Do people come in missing paperwork that you know is necessary? Are you offering valuable services but are unable to attract interest and attention?</p>
            <p>Writing for residents means moving away from language focused on departments and levels of your bureaucracy to language focused on the daily needs of the residents we serve. We’ll discuss how to organize content outside of your org chart, how to shape communications to be service-oriented, and how to write for accessibility across digital platforms and physical environments.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">You’ll leave with methods and tools that will make it easier for you to write content that uses plain language and is accessible for everyone. Please bring a printed page of existing content or a rough draft that you would like to refine, as we’ll have time at the end of the workshop to incorporate what you learned into your draft.</p>
