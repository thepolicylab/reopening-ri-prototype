problem: Public safety agencies across the region saw a critical need for a unified computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system to integrate across Police, Fire, EMS, Aviation, Transportation, and Travis County Sheriff for 911.
solution: The team developed a service level agreement to incorporate subject matter experts from each agency to support software governance. They designed a lifecycle management process to keep all systems secure, monitored, and up-to-date with the latest technology in compliance with NIST standards and industry best practices. They have built a fantastic rapport with the public safety community and consistently strive to maintain and strengthen these relationships
sustainable: The team must stay ahead of the curve by being prepared for upcoming emerging technologies.
advice: Prioritize customer engagement and business relationship management as a necessary facet of enterprise system support. When a team is formed its goal should be to fit the needs of its customers through common goals and a shared vision.
