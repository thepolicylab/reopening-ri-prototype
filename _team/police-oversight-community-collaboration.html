title: Improving police oversight through community collaboration
permalink: awards/2019/police-oversight-community-collaboration
organization: City of Austin
teamname: Office of Police Oversight

problem: The Office of Police Oversight provides impartial oversight over the Austin Police Department (APD). Community members face barriers to contacting the office, including historical community fear and lack of trust in law enforcement and City processes.
solution: Director Farah Muscadin has implemented focused outreach as a tool of equity-minded community engagement to address fear and mistrust and bridge the gap between communities and institutions. Her approach centers on direct connection, empathy, education, and creating sustainable partnerships.
sustainable: In order for this focused outreach initiative to be sustainable, the Office of Police Oversight must work collaboratively with stakeholders at all levels and remain creative and responsive to the community.
advice: My advice to others working to build trust between institutions and community is to never underestimate the power of empathy and relationship-building. Change happens at the rate of relationships.
