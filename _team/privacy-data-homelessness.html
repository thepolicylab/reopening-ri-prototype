title: Ensuring privacy with data around homelessness
permalink: awards/2019/privacy-data-homelessness
organization: City of Austin
teamname: Neighborhood Housing

problem: There was a paucity of geospatial data on people experiencing homelessness which made it difficult to effectively provide services that work to end homelessness.
solution: We created a Story Map in ArcGIS Online that combined geospatial data on interactions that City services had with people experiencing homelessness for internal City use. We are now using MapMasq to apply statistical noise to share the map publicly without putting people experiencing homelessness at risk.
sustainable: It is fundamental that the data connected to the map is automatically updated and that there are clear data standards.
advice: Be conservative with estimates on how long a project will take. New projects that involve collaboration and innovative ways of doing business can take significant time to implement.
