title: Public dataset and AI for making images more accessible 
permalink: awards/2019/dataset-ai-images-accessible
organization: University of Texas at Austin
teamname: School of Information
img: dataset-ai-images-accessible.jpg
problem: People who are blind or have low vision regularly seek visual assistance for a wide range of tasks, including to describe pictures they take themselves and find online. The artificial intelligence (AI) for this task remains a challenge, so we rely on humans to provide descriptions.
solution: This work introduces the first publicly-available image captioning dataset for images originating from people who are blind or have low vision, an AI-based interactive assistant to improve the dataset, and interviews with end users to understand how to improve the dataset and functionality over time.
sustainable: The team recognizes the need to promote this work on a broader scale. Following our standard practices, the team is releasing all code and datasets to facilitate future extensions, and publishing in conferences and journals.
advice: Interdisciplinary research is exciting and has the potential for great impact, but takes significant time and effort to become productive. It is important to make regular, sustained interactions a key component of a successful interdisciplinary project.
