title: Trash collection kiosks for people experiencing homelessness
permalink: awards/2019/trash-collection-homelessness
organization: City of Austin
teamname: Parks & Recreation Department

problem: We wanted to create a way for individuals experiencing homelessness to bag their household trash, that didnâ€™t require a daily or weekly handout of bags. We also needed a safe way for sharps to be collected and disposed of properly.
solution: Design and create an onsite, non-permanent, trash bag kiosk dispenser so that people experiencing homelessness could utilize the bags to dispose of trash created. Secondly, design and create an onsite tamper-proof sharps disposal that would be safe for staff removing sharps for permanent disposal.
sustainable: Dedicated funding for new trash bag kiosks/sharps container with the addition of sites in other high need areas to be added to the Austin Resource Recovery routes.
advice: Add informational signage to the kiosk about the need and benefits of providing trash services at these locations.
