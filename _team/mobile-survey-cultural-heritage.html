title: Citizen-led mobile surveys to document and celebrate cultural heritage
permalink: awards/2019/mobile-survey-cultural-heritage
organization: Office of Historic Preservation
teamname: City of San Antonio - ScoutSA

problem: Historic resource surveys inform development processes including planning, permitting, and incentive programs, but traditional paper-based data collection methods lack transparency and accessibility.
solution: ScoutSA developed a mobile app to expedite and streamline data collection in the field. In addition to this traditional architectural survey meeting state and federal standards, ScoutSA created a public interface to empower communities to share, preserve, and celebrate their cultural heritage.
sustainable: A dual commitment to transparency in the collection process and accessibility to the data will drive our next steps. We are building a volunteer team to lead community-driven survey campaigns.
advice: Flexible, iterative projects that respond to new technologies and local needs! Since our launch, four community-led historic district designations used variations of the digital survey, representing the first new districts in 10 years.
