permalink: awards/2019/learning-from-lived-experience
organization: City of Austin
teamname: Downtown Municipal Court

problem: How might we develop a system that's going to be efficient and effective and move people out of the state of homelessness? How might we understand why this is happening?
solution: Downtown Municipal Court runs the Austin Homelessness Advisory Council which gives people with lived experiences the ability to co-create and provide feedback on the City's approach to solving issues for people experiencing homelessness.
sustainable: Austin’s Downtown Municipal Court has taken on long-term management of the Homelessness Advisory Council
advice: It’s important to work against the inertia of working at your desk. We need more ways to get out into the community and engage with residents.
