problem: Women and people of color are less likely to enjoy Austinâ€™s entrepreneurial ecosystem prosperity. A major reason for this inequality is because this target population does not have the same access to entrepreneurship education and training as their non-minority counterparts.
solution: The Center assists women and people of color to launch, grow, and sustain businesses. The Center provides entrepreneurs with the tools necessary to increase profitability and drive job creation while encouraging innovation. One of the ways that CEI plans to achieve its objectives is by hosting workshops that are focused on technology, access to capital, finance, and other knowledge areas.
sustainable: Constantly seeking grants and other funding opportunities are important for sustainability. Writing grants and staying connected with private and public organizations and government agencies to learn of potential sources.
advice: If we had to do it all over, we would first align with supporters who can offer advice and funding. Also, networking is crucial. We developed our entrepreneurship network after the creation of the Center, instead of before.
