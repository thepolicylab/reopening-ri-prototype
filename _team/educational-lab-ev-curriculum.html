problem: Education is key in the EV movement to drive adoption of electric vehicles. Culture change and behavior shift can be achieved through the educational living lab model.
solution: EVs for Schools brings EV charging stations with correlating curriculum to public school campuses to enable next generation adoption of EV technology. The core of the project is to influence students with cutting-edge technology advancing STEM programs while providing the convenience of workplace charging for teachers.
sustainable: Continued outreach with educators to share the curriculum; Other school districts in Austin and the nation replicate the program; New building and remodels at existing schools to make campuses EV ready
advice: Seek out public-private partnerships to launch initiatives in your own communities; Ensure commitment from school principal and staff; Deploy in schools with low resources to reach children and families who are economically disadvantaged
