title: Working across the community for better food policy
permalink: awards/2019/community-food-policy
organization: Austin Office of Sustainability
teamname: Food Policy Board

problem: How can the City of Austin make it more simple and cost-effective to run a safe, and compliant healthy food pantry?
solution: Differentiate charitable feeding organizations (CFOs) from other food establishments and establish category subtypes, create registration process and best management practices with Austin Public Health for each subtype based on level of risk, and waive fees for CFOs.
sustainable: Buy-in from City Council for fee waivers and continued cooperation from City Department Executives and Staff to revise and develop new processes.
advice: While we did a good job of mapping stakeholders in the early stages, we didnâ€™t necessarily understand the full environment enough to know who the specific contacts of key individual players would be. I would spend more time identifying these people earlier.
