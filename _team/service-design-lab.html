title: Service Design Lab for working with residents to improve city services
permalink: awards/2019/service-design-lab
organization: Austin Office of Design & Delivery
teamname: Service Design Lab
img: service-design-lab.jpg
problem: City staff need support in improving how we deliver services to residents throughout our community.
solution: Building on the success of the Service Design Studio in NYC’s Mayor’s Office of Economic Opportunity, Austin’s Office of Design & Delivery developed a Service Design Lab in 2018 to scale the capacity for city employees to work across organizational silos and directly with community members to design new programs, processes, and policies based on community needs.
sustainable: Full-time employee positions to support the organization around management and operations, in addition to updates to payscales and job descriptions for the modern era.
advice: When people ask for help but you don’t have time, write down the details. A lot of organizations don’t know how much help is being requested, because most requests never make it up to the top. The list of folks in need can be a compelling case for structural change.
