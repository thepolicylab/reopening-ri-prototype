problem: There’s the stigma that citizens should not expect a government employee to go above and beyond; much less break through any red tape and be more than a robot.
solution: Be the one who cares. Be empathetic to your citizens. Don’t be afraid to ask if information can be shared. If you’re only allowed to share a certain piece of information; make sure it’s shared in a way that anyone could understand, even if that means wording it differently. Take time to do it right. By responding to every person on the chosen media channel, we ensured residents felt their concerns were heard and action was being taken to get their lives back to normal.
sustainable: If there’s information the public wants to know that has not been addressed, share that with your decision makers. If it can’t be delivered quickly, ensure a time when it will be.
advice: If there’s information the public wants to know that has not been addressed, share that with your decision makers. If it can’t be delivered quickly, ensure a time when it will be.
