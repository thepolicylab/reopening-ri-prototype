problem: The change that we are trying to incorporate is reducing the exposure to risk. Historically, we have not immediately upgraded our first responders with the latest tools for gathering data on the emergency scene.
solution: Through the use of robotics, the fire service has an opportunity to rapidly collect vital information through remote sensing devices. It is through aerial, ground, and maritime robotics that first responders can now remotely begin operations and remain remote in order to enhance firefighter safety and improve services.
sustainable: We must have continued support from upper management and city leaders. This includes resources and funding. There must be continued opportunities for exploration into the robotics industry.
advice: I think we were able to find the right approach in navigating the negative connotations that were initially attached to UAV technology.
