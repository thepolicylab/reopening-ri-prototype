title: Pop-Up ATX for Code Education
permalink: awards/2019/pop-up-atx
organization: Austin Code Department
teamname: Code Education & Outreach Division

problem: Some Austinites live in “resource deserts” and may face a variety of barriers to accessing City services, meanwhile department staff often work in silos as we strive to engage the community.
solution: The Division partnered with other City departments to make resources more accessible for hard-to-reach communities by “popping up” in outlying parts of Austin to provide City services (mobile library, health checks, etc.) while staff share information so that we may more effectively serve residents.
sustainable: Over 10 departments have already joined the movement and proactively “pop-up” throughout Austin. This collaboration is the driving force that sustains Pop-Up ATX in effectively engaging our community.
advice: To make the next Pop-Up ATX more inclusive and engaging, welcome volunteers will orient residents to the services available on-site and partners are encouraged to have bilingual staff or interpreters.
