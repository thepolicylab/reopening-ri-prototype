title: Starting with user needs in providing better forms
permalink: awards/2019/user-needs-forms
organization: City of Austin
teamname: Communications & Technology Management
img: user-needs-forms.jpg
problem: Due to limitations with the City of Austin’s current tool for online forms, we were tasked with finding a platform that is more robust in functionality and integration and meets the needs of city staff across departments as they build and maintain digital forms.
solution: We started with the users first and not the technology - interviewing users to understand their needs and inviting them to the table to test with us and select tools that would work for their business. Vendors filled out the evaluation tool consisting of the user requirements, security requirements, vendor information, and unique qualities. The vendors understood that our findings and information would be shared internally and externally.
sustainable: Technology, humans and business have to work together to sustain a useful, sustainable, solution.
advice: The key is that “you’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.”
