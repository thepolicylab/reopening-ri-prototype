problem: Recidivism and permanent loss of opportunity for the youngest members of our adult criminal justice system (and our community) when a teen is convicted, revoked, or receives jail time in a non violent case.
solution: Provide teenage criminal non-violent offenders the opportunity to avoid jail and a permanent conviction, through a sentence that offers as much support as it does punishment; requiring every defendant to engage in our community, do 100 hours of service, set out personal goals, and be working or in school.
sustainable: The continued generosity of our community, Non-profits who offer service and leadership projects to our teen defendants, speakers who come to our court, at monthly settings, to teach and inspire.
advice: Trust in the generosity of people in our community and the desire so many have to give young people a second chance. Don't be afraid to think creatively in a job that might not outwardly call for it.
