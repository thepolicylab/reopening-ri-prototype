title: Cultivating equity in the built environment
permalink: awards/2019/equity-built-environment
organization: Austin Energy
teamname: Green Building Commercial

problem: A green building works not only to mitigate climate change and benefit the economy; the critical piece is to advance human culture, and includes whether a building provides a healthy environment for the people who construct and use them.
solution: The Austin Energy Green Building commercial team developed an Innovation Guide with ways for designers and builders to promote equity in buildings. The guide includes methods to design inclusive restrooms, support family planning, include affordable housing, and support construction skills training.
sustainable: Designers and builders are recognizing new ways that they can play a role in bolstering disadvantaged communities through design, by seeing sustainability as a social justice issue and creating places of support and inclusion.
advice: In an environment when cost drives most construction decisions, promoting equity through the built environment requires that designers and builders be advocates for providing an inclusive community.
