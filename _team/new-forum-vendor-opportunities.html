title: A new forum for connecting vendors with opportunities
permalink: awards/2019/new-forum-vendor-opportunities
organization: City of Austin
teamname: Purchasing Office

problem: Our office wanted to attract more vendor interest in our solicitations and to increase contracts with small and minority and women-owned businesses. We wanted to increase our visibility in the community and demystify the City’s procurement process.
solution: We participated and presented in outreach events to inform about the City’s procurement process.  We also reported how much COA departments spend, breaking down information into commodities, helping vendors understand where to focus.
sustainable: Continued outreach is required to educate small businesses about the City’s evolving processes. Also, providing vendors with updated information about past procurements will help them better understand how to plan for the future.
advice: Ensure you have a team that is willing to try new things, engage your entire office, begin planning early, and always strive to improve beyond previous efforts.  Also, surveying attendees for ideas and focused marketing will provide guidance.
